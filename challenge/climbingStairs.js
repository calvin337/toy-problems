// Description:
// You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top. Your solution will need to be optimized to run in O(n) time complexity.

// Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

// Test Cases:
// climbStairs(0) => 0
// climbStairs(1) => 1
// climbStairs(5) => 8
// climbStairs(10) => 89

// Code:
function climbStairs (n) {

}
