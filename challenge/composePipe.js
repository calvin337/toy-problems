// Description:

// Implement the functions compose and pipe.

// Compose
// Compose should return a function that is the composition of a list of functions of arbitrary length. Each function is called on the return value of the function that follows.

// You can think of compose as moving right to left through its arguments.

// Pipe:
// Pipe composes a series of functions and returns the resulting function. Each function is called on the return value of the preceding function.

// You can think of pipe as moving left to right through its arguments.

// Code:

var compose = function(){
  //Your code here  
};

var pipe = function(){
  //Your code here  
};
