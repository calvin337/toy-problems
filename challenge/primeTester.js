// Description:
// A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has no divisors other than itself and 1. Write a function that accepts a number and returns true if it’s a prime number, false if it’s not. The grader is looking at the efficiency of your solution (number of operations) as well as correctness! 

// Test Cases:
// primeTester(2) => true;
// primeTester(1) => false;

// Code:
function primeTester (n) {

}
