// Description:
// Selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort which repeatedly selects the next-smallest element and swaps it into place.

// For the first iteration, we find the smallest element in the array and swap it with the first element in the array.
// On the second iteration, we find the next smallest element in the array and swap it with the second element in the array.
// etc.

// Implement a function that takes an array and sorts it using this technique.

// NOTE: DO NOT use JavaScriptâ€™s built-in sorting function (Array.prototype.sort).

// Code:

function selectionSort(arr) {

}
